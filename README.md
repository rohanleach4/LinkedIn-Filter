A Chrome Extension that filters your LinkedIn feed. It exists to inspire users to use ChatGPT to code

It's easy for people like me to say _AI_ applications are the future and that _you_ will struggle if you are not a part of this new movement.
But how does saying this help people who have only heard of AI and need help figuring out what to do with it?

It doesn't.

You don't need to code to use an AI like ChatGTP, but I believe a user will get more out of it if they have a basic command of code.

Can an environment be created where a user can use ChatGTP to assist them at every stage of creating an app they can use daily and customise to their needs?

As a solution have created a trivial Chrome extension that is the greatest thing ever to happen to LinkedIn ;)

This Chrome extension removes any comment from 2nd and 3rd connections, leaving only content from 1st connections and those you follow.
This simple app works on many levels:

* It removes one of the miseries of LinkedIn - unwanted noise in your feed.
* It introduces people without experience to Github, Chrome extensions, how to build a simple application, and real-world usage of ChatGPT.
* As a skeleton app, you can customise it to deliver the content you want to see. As you grow, your app can grow, too - ChatGPT will be able to help you here.
* If you don't know how to download or clone an app from Github, you can find the answer with ChatGPT.
* If you need to learn what a Chrome extension is or how to install an app, you can ask ChatGPT.
* If you want to modify the skeleton app and add a new feature, you can ask ChatGPT.
* If you want to pad out the Chrome extension and make it a full-blown app, you can ask ChatGPT.
